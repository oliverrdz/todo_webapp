# Web apps

I want to practice using the Django framework. For that I will be creating several web applications that I think would be useful for myself. So far this is what I would like to build:

* Todo app
* Bookmarks
* Money tracker
* Goal tracker
* RSS reader

I will record my progress in my website.
